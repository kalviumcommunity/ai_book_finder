# BookBot – AI Book Finder (Gemini + Flask + React)

BookBot is a chat-style book recommendation app. Type what you’re in the mood for and get curated picks with quick links (including Goodreads). The UI renders a message-by-message conversation; book results appear as cards with outbound links only.

## Stack
- Backend: Flask, Google Generative AI (Gemini), Google Books API
- Frontend: React (Vite)
- Runtime: Node 18+ for frontend, Python 3.10+ for backend

## Features
- Chat conversation (user ↔ bot) with bubbles
- Always returns book recommendations with Goodreads links when possible
- Uses Google Books API for metadata (title, authors, description, info link)
- Clean, responsive UI with suggestion chips

## Quickstart

### 1) Clone and prerequisites
- Ensure Python 3.10+ and Node 18+ are installed and available in PATH

### 2) Backend setup
```bash
cd backend
# Install dependencies (Windows)
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or (if python/pip are on PATH)
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:
```bash
API_Key=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
```
Run the server:
```bash
py main.py
# Server: http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### 3) Frontend setup
```bash
cd frontend/client
npm install
npm run dev
# Open the URL printed by Vite (e.g., http://localhost:5173)
```

## How it works
- The frontend sends your prompt to `POST /api/prompt`.
- The backend first queries Google Books with your text. If results are found, they’re returned (with a computed Goodreads link per title).
- If no direct results are found, the backend asks Gemini to suggest a few titles and then looks those up via Google Books; the first good matches are returned.
- The frontend renders a bot bubble with either text or a grid of recommendation cards.

## API

### POST `/api/prompt`
Request body:
```json
{ "prompt": "fantasy romance with enemies-to-lovers" }
```
Response (typical):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Circe",
    "authors": ["Madeline Miller"],
    "description": "…",
    "link": "https://books.google.com/...",
    "goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Circe"
  }
]
```
Or a plain text string in rare edge cases.

### POST `/api/embeddings`
Simple wrapper around Gemini embeddings (used for future extensions):
```json
{ "text": "The Song of Achilles" }
```
Returns a vector and dimension count.

## Environment variables
- `API_Key`: Your Gemini API key

Optional (network/dev):
- `FLASK_ENV=development` to enable Flask debug (already uses `debug=True` in `main.py`)

---

## Development scripts
- Backend: run `py main.py` inside `backend/`
- Frontend: `npm run dev` inside `frontend/client/`

### Linting (frontend)
```bash
cd frontend/client
npm run lint
```

## Design notes
- No images are generated by the AI. Book cards only contain text and links.
- The UI shows suggestion chips to quickly seed prompts.
- User messages appear as right-aligned yellow bubbles; bot messages as left-aligned white bubbles.

---

## Troubleshooting
- Pip/Python not found (Windows): use `py -m pip ...` and `py main.py`.
- CORS issues: Flask app already enables CORS; ensure backend is running on `127.0.0.1:5000`.
- Empty results: Try a more specific prompt (genre + vibe + trope). The backend will still attempt a Gemini-assisted search.
- 403/401 from Gemini: verify `API_Key` in `backend/.env` and that your key has access to the selected model (`gemini-1.5-flash`).
